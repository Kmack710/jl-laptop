## Just an edit of jl-laptop to work with my scripts 
## This is set up to work directly with 710-carBoosting on ESX or qbcore! 

## All credit goes to the orginal creators - I just did this edit cause I suck at UI and figured others would like this edit as well that use my script!


## Requires https://github.com/kmack710/710-lib 

## All other apps work like before Just the boosting app was edited to work with 710-carBoosting
